## Warning!
Using a program that generates random links for prnt.sc website can be risky. Prnt.sc is a website for hosting screenshots, and you never know what image you will get. The URLs generated by this program are easy to guess or scrape, making it alarmingly easy for anyone to view grabs of private messages or sensitive information. Even though these images are publically available, it is important to be cautious about the content you are viewing. Some of these images may be inappropriate or NSFW, and you may not want to expose yourself to such content. If you do decide to use this program, make sure to exercise caution and be aware of the risks involved. It is always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your online privacy and security. (Also doesn't work in Russia without VPN, sorry!)
